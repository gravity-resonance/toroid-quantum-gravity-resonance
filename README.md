## Overview

This work explores a novel quantum-gravity resonance condition:  
> **λ = Rₛ**,  
where the de Broglie wavelength of a quantum wave matches the Schwarzschild radius of the system's gravitational mass.

Two primary experimental configurations are examined:

1. A graphene-coated tungsten **toroid**
2. A dense **nanoparticle cloud** aligned via magnetic field lines

These designs aim to bring quantum–gravitational symmetry into laboratory reach using known materials and no exotic physics.
