# Toroid and Nanoparticle Models for Quantum-Gravitational Resonance

This repository presents a theoretical framework for achieving quantum‚Äìgravitational resonance through engineered symmetry between the de‚ÄØBroglie wavelength and the Schwarzschild radius:
$\lambda = R_s$  

While this relationship naturally arises only at the Planck scale ‚Äî and in a single object under extreme relativistic conditions ‚Äî we propose a **two-subsystem approach** to realize it in laboratory-accessible systems.

## Core Idea

The resonance condition is constructed between two physical subsystems:

* A **mass subsystem** (tungsten), providing most of the gravitational mass:
  $R_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}$
* A **wave subsystem** (graphene electrons), providing mobile quantum waves:
  $\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}$

By tuning electron velocities or using relativistic drift, one can match the effective wave to the mass‚Äôs Schwarzschild radius.

## Investigated Configurations

1. **Graphene-coated tungsten toroid**
2. **Dense cloud of graphene-coated tungsten nanoparticles**

These hybrid systems allow the de‚ÄØBroglie wavelength to approach the Schwarzschild radius at:
$\lambda = R_s \approx 10^{-25} \, \text{m}$

These images show the coupling between mass and wave subsystems in a structured configuration, enabling a symmetry not accessible in standard particles.

## Motivation

* Explore possible access to quantum‚Äìgravitational interaction without new particles or speculative physics.
* Inspire new directions in experimental setups involving **structured mass‚Äìwave systems**.
* Open a route toward speculative applications in **resonant energy systems**, **propulsion concepts**, and **black hole analogs**.
